-Abstract class is almost same with concrete class except for it cannot be instantiated;

-Interface can have abstract, default, static methods that are public by default, and static and final variables that are public by default as well;

-Abstract class vs interface :

1) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.	Interface supports multiple inheritance.
2) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.	Interface has only static and final variables.
3) A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.	Members of a Java interface are public by default.
